[Comedy Calendar](calendar.md)

**This a record of my attempt to perform 50 open mic comedy gigs in 2019.  I also want to write 180 jokes (3 jokes a minute? hey! that's a one hour show).  I want to laugh a lot - and who knows? Maybe make somebody else laugh as well.**

### Don't Dwell on the Negatives...
I've seen a few promoters of open mic comedy nights complaining about acts either turning up late or not turning up at all and threatening to not allow acts on if they don't turn up at their alloted time.

I can easily see that it must be very annoying if you're a promoter that acts either don't turn up, or swan in at the last minute.  On the other hand, I think it's really important to remember that the acts are doing what they do for *FREE* - and if it's a bringer, they're also imposing on someone else to come with them.

A promoter has just told me that I shouldn't try to get a spot at his gig because I've dared to cancel his gig and then advertise that I'm free that night to be a bringer.  I'm sorry - do we have any kind of relationship of obligation? When I cancelled your gig it was because I wasn't free that night.  When I advertised that I can be a bringer that was because my circ's had changed.

### Joke No. 38

And that's why we say "You can't make an omelette without breaking legs." - Ah - sorry, wrong speech - that's just the end of my talk on Mary Berry's martial arts course: Dùn tāng de fāngshì - way of the blunt spoon.  You don't spend 10 years standing next to a Scouser and keep your jewellery without knowing a thing or two about defending yourself with kithchen implements.

Yeah that's right. It's just a basic joke about people from Liverpool being criminals dressed up in a cultural reference and a twinset and perls.

### Gig No. 12 Rising Star and the King and Queen in Fitzrovia
The compere completely threw me by owning up to being the elephant. But these are definitely the biggest laughs I've got so far this year.

### Joke No. 37 Bermuda Triangle
As part of the oral sex humming bit? Bermuda triangle, by Barry Manilow?

### Joke No. 36 Comfort Zone
I like comedy.  It pushes me outside of my comfort zone.  And to be clear my comfort zone is sitting at home watching an episode of Poirot where I can't remember who the murder is, while asking my wife "what's wrong" and she's still not so drunk that she's actually going to tell me.

### Gig No. 11 - Funny Box Live - The Good Intent

I have a confession to make. I am a coward and an idiot. OK, the whole thing went a bit weird.  I had rehearsed a 5 minute set pretty solidly because I was expecting some people I knew to turn up as bringers. Then just at the end of day I noticed that actually I was *headlining* and I was supposed to 10 minutes.  So that was a rather hurried session of stitching back in some bits that I thought were maybe to rude to perform in front of my friends.  Then I get to the pub. And the pub is rough as. And the stage where the stand-up is happening isn't in a separate room, it's just at one end of the bar.  And the locals are rough as.

The compere is a delightful young guy called Richard.  Who is seriously visually impaired, but is doing a stella job anyway.  And I am definitely going to do my 10 minutes. But I'm a bit worried about my guests coming to this rough as pub.  So I ring my wife in a panic.  Sort of half hoping that she'll volunteer to come out and rescue our friends. And she says, get out of there. What the hell are you doing in such a rough pub.  And then guess what happened?

* The locals moved to the other bar
* The place filled up with comics and their Bringers
* Everthing was fine, my friends enjoyed themselves
* I went on last, and if not exactly smashing it, did OK

So it just goes to show.  A cowardly comic dies a thousand times.  A brave one, well a bit less.

### Tuesday February 19th 2019

### Joke No. 35 - Brian Blessed

Blessed are the peacemakers - Jesus said that.  Except Brian Blessed.  He's really loud.  Jesus didn't say that. But he could have, because you see Jesus is God on earth.  And God is omniscient he knows everything across all of space and time.  So when Jesus was delivering the sermon on the mount, he was aware - even though he was talking in Aramaic, he was aware that there'd be pun in the English translation.  But he didn't go for it.
But then, I suppose Jesus isn't really a stand-up comedian - he's more of a hang-up tragedian. 

### Joke No. 34 -  Millenials

Millenials? Eh? Who are they? Nobody seems to know.  People who've been born since the year 2000 people who've never know a world without the internet? People who like making hats? That's a niches artisanal craft pun there. Because people who like making hats are called milliners.

They like drinking mud don't they? They all seem to be carrying around plastic bottles filled with mud.  Huel. A food that not only looks the same going down as it does coming back up, but sounds the same as well. Do you know what I find weirdest? The Christmast dinner version? Liquidised turkey sprouts and all the trimmings.  Including pudding.  Yuel Huel.

And they, and by they I mean most you. Like putting their feet on the seats don't they? Why is that? Do you do that in your own house? Oh, sorry you don't own one do you. Is that what it is?  I don't have a sofa to call my own, I shall soil all the public ones.

And tights.  Everybody is wearing tights. Men are wearing tights. Women are wearing tights. 

### Joke No. 33 - Psycotic episode

I this new material or a psychotic episode? Probably too early to tell.


### Monday February 18th

### Bringer No. 7 - Funny Feckers - The Dean Swift
This was a hilarious packed-out night. With the joke that stayed in my mind being the one from Vanessa Hua about her nickname being "Van."

Funny Feckers is kind of the rolls-royce of open-mic bringer gigs. With somehow an even better vibe to it than the Cavendish Arms - with some kind of suspicion that more actual punters might be in the audience.  I would like to get on here, but I'm also a bit initimidated. It's certainly not really a new material night, although there were people on last night, including Katie Price who I've seen just a couple of months ago who were *much much* improved. It's a bit daunting.

The opening comic was the only one that really struggled, and that was until he hit his stride dealing with the hecklers in the front row.

It's made me more determined than ever to "hothouse" my comedy. I'm starting to think that the speed of my improvement will be directly connected to how much stage time and hothousing I've done.  The reason that hothousing feels so hard is that it's performing without the magical support of the audience. But I've got some strategies to do it anyway.

I did an extra, not-strictly-stand-up comedy gig last week - Stand-up Agile. But at it I met a fellow stand-up comedian. Who recommended a couple of books that are hard to find on Amazon. "Killer Stand-up Comedy :Course 1:interactive Writing Guide by Steve Roye." I don't think I agree with eerything that he says. But one thing that I did find interesting was the idea of using stand-up comedy to teach things.  In fact it has given me an idea.

### Wednesday February 13th 

### Joke No. 32 - Shots Fired

Shh! What's that? Shots fired. \[Sniffs elaborately\] Baileys? Absinthe, Feuerzangenbowle lit with a pertrol-fuelled Zippo lighter. Old school! What's that? \[Sniffs again\] the tears of Vicorian children corporally punished for even the slightest disciplinary lapse? Very old school.

### Tuesday February 12th 2019

### Joke No. 31 -  Weirdest thing
What's the weirdest thing you've got into trouble for doing *while* you're having sex?

I got in a lot of trouble for answering general knowledge questions on Radio 4's Brain of Britain.

### Joke No. 30 - Bee holder
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Honey is in the hive of the beeholder 

### Joke No. 29 - Now that's what I call Music

When I lost weight something very strange happened - I started to get morning wood again. Which hadn't happened since I was in my early 20's.  It was a real surprise to find something I hadn't seen since the 80's in my pants.  Like finding Now That's What I Call Music Volume 3 in there on cassette.

### Joke No. 28 - Heckler put down.

What was that you said? What? What? Can't hear you.
Now you're talking! And I really wish you wouldn't.

### Sunday February 10th 2019

### Joke No. 27 -  Brexit forever

They say that all good things come to an end.  Which is why I know that Brexit will go on for fucking ever.

### Friday February 8th 2019

### Joke No. 26 - You've Been Framed

My advice is never attempt any activity that you've seen go horribly wrong on You've Been Framed.

Trampolining. Roller skating.  Marriage.

### Joke No. 25 - Netflix Death check

Have ever watched so much Netflix that Netflix thinks it needs to check if you're dead? You know - it pops up that little window?
"Are you still watching Netflix?" You appear to have been watching Silent Witness for 42 staight episodes.  If you are doing that to spank off to Emilia Fox - you probably need some fluids.

---

Ho hum. I don't have any gigs for a whole week. And I'm really missing it. The main thing that I want to do today is hothouse my routine (my wife had promised that she'll also listen to it).  I also want to do the "Fucking Toto" material so that I absolutely get the most out of it).

### Gig No. 10 - Happy Laugh Craft -  Hoop and Toy, South Kensington

<br />

So I took out all the bits that I thought weren't working, but didn't seem to be able to connect. So I'm comforting myself, listening back to this that at least I'm clear. I can be heard. I'm not talking too fast, I'm not humming and ahing. They're listening to what I have to say.

What is occurring to me now is that I'm wondering what they want. 

The best joke of the night was an ISA/Isis pun.  And again - I didn't get the name.

### Joke No. 24

It's always darkest just before the Dawn.  That's what we say in my family.  Because Dawn is huge.  She blocks out the light.

### Joke No. 23 - Plasticity

Men's sexuality is fixed pretty early in life. Women's sexuality is more fluid.  This is called erotic plasticity.  It means that after certain age woman prefer a vibrator.

No, no.  It means that even though women might have been straight all their lives they still might decide might find later in life that they actually are more attracted to women. 

### Joke No. 22 - Wittgenstein

The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein said that we are all asleep, but sometimes we are awake enough to know that we are dreaming. That's not an announcement you want to hear from the cockpit is it?

Are we even gonna make it to Benidorm?

### Joke No. 21 - Ailments

I thought I'd just talk about my ailments for a bit - because I know that that's really sexy. Especially genito-urinary ailments - that's the hot stuff isn't it?

### Joke No. 20 - More Elephant in the room

You see the Elephant in the room is an interesting idea because it's obviously insane.  There is no Elephant in the room. If there were an elephant in this room, that would be a complete disaster, it would be mayhem.  I was at gig just recently when somebody brought a pitbull to an open mic gig.  That was bad enough.

Actually having an elephant in this room would be disastrous.  But suggesting that there could be - that's easy. I just did it.  And once you've suggested an idea, no matter how crazy.  There are some people who think - "OK - why not?"

And that's why we have Brexit.


### Gig No. 9 - Comedy 42 Stoke Newington

I think last night was one of the best. With some people coming up to me at the end and saying that they liked my set, in a room that had a *lot* of good comedians. 

The chap who runs Comedy 42 is called Vittorio and he runs it very well.  I like the night at lot. It's in a cocktail bar under a kebab shop and they will bring the kebabs to your table as you watch the comedy! What's not to like about that!

One thing that's interesting now - and I think this is something that I need to get better at - is polishing the bits that work. There's a bit in the bit about oral sex that I think I've only managed to do once and I haven't managed to do right yet.  It would be great to get that right. And I think that probably needs some hot housing.  If I'm not going out doing gigs for a while, then I'll get a chance to do that I suppose.

At the same time I'm exasperated that I can't get the Brexit stuff to fly, and I'm wondering if it needs to be a combination of hothousing (that's my fancy word for practice) and actually writing out the routines and thinking of different bits that I can add.

I wrote this little computer program called "ekeez" - after "Cadaver Equise" which is a surrealist game. I would really like my comedy to be more surreal but the stuff that I've tried in this area (the monkey's driving the bus stuff that I tried last night) hasn't worked. Yet.  I'm going to say yet. See? Positive thinking. All the little program does is read the last line from a file and then print it out, and then wait for you to type in another line, which it adds to the file. This is basically playing a game on my own that Logan Murray taught us how to play in groups. 

When I've got a bunch of these "cadavers, equise" I'll think about reading them out - maybe just reading them out verbatim. Another thing that I learned from Logan is that if you do that kind of thing and you give the nonsense that you're reading full weight, you will get laughs.

I know you don't care about any of these technical details, but I do think I'm going to also play with something called "Infinite ekeez", because the one that I have at the moment kind of relies on my not remembering what the thing before the last thing was. But don't worry.  I have a plan.

### Gig No. 8 - Right Funny Comedy Clapham

Better - there's a ton more fun "down there" on what can be hummed. It's a good gig because it always gets genuine punters as well as other comedians and their bringers.

<br />


### Joke No. 19 - Monkey driving Brexit
So there's been a thing on a lot of social media pages about a bus driver losing his job because he let a monkey drive his bus for a few minutes.

Which is weird because the British people have been letting Monkeys drive Brexit for over two years - no punishment so far - I think it might be coming.

### Joke No. 18 - Favourite Pronouns

So some people have started putting their preferred pronouns in their twitter profiles.  And I'm totally fine with that.  Refer to yourself however you want, make it easier for people to address you as you want to be addressed.  Totally fine.  But I was thinking that I don't really mind what pronouns you use for me "he him his."  "They, them, their", "It it its."  Who am I kidding I'm a comedian my preferred pronouns are I, I, I and ME, ME, ME.

But I was thinking I definitely have a preferred noun.  Pudding. 

### Joke No. 17 - (audience bit) 

Good evening madam - do you identify as a woman? Can I ask you is there any possibility of you initiating a sexual encounter with me? What no? That's fine.  You're in control of this thing. I totally respect that.

### Joke No. 16 - Hull is Other People

What if you were in Hell - who would be there with you? In my case, I was imagining that it would be a very beautiful woman who won't sleep with me.  My mum.  Somebody who's a lot cleverer than me and a total racist idiot.  And if life really is a sick joke, what about hell being living with these people in Hull?  What kind of joke is worse than a pun?

### Gig No. 7 - Ken Uncut, the Hoop and Toy South Kensington

Gigging in the afternoon? Weird.  I was focused on setting up a timer and recording my set and as a result managed to do neither. So no recording to post here.

I thought a lot of the other comedians were *very* good and I did find myself spilling out into the South Kensington freezing afternoon wondering why I am doing this (the questions pretty much everybody else asks me).

But I did do the whole of the Fucking ToTo, ToTo, TuTu. Bit which I've no idea where it came from, but there we are. So I came away with a bunch of resolutions.

1) Hothouse your routines when you have new material in them (I don't quite know how I'm going to do that before tomorrow night, but, anyway, that's the resolution).
2) Keep writing - doing the hadron joke collider etc really works, even when it doesn't work.
3) When you think somebody is really funny (like yesterday, there was a guy with long hair and glasses who was really funny) get there name and then you can write about how funny they are.

OK that's enough resolutions. 

### Joke No. 15 - Fucking Tutu

No I actually like being married. And I love my wife. I don't know did I break some basic comedy rule.  But actually getting married was complicated a bit by the injuries from my stag night.

Hey, it wasn't their fault really I suppose.  But my mates thought it would be funny to dress me up in a skirt and tights. And I'm not that used to wearing that kind of gear.  So we were waiting to go up in the life to Sushi Samba in Heron Tower - I know, classy. And my skirt got kind of stuck in the lift and it pulled me off the ground and then it was starting to cut through my skin and if one of my friends hadn't had the initiative to whip out his swiss army knife and cut me out of it, I might have been killed.  But unfortunately by that time, I had been pulled by the skirt to the top of the lift door, so when he did cut me free, I kind of plummeted down and smack my head on the floor.  So that was pretty much an end to the stag night and I was in a cast for my wedding.

Fucking Tutu.

### Joke No. 14 - Fucking Toto Number 2

So I took a break from comedy for a while and I was living and working in Kansas.  In a part of America they call "Tornado alley."

And one day while I was sitting in my studio apartment.  The tornado alarm went off, and I could actually see the thing like a giant plughole in the sky.  So I was running towards the underground car park that was the tornado shelter.  But just as I got to safety this cute little dog ran the other way - back into the apartment building.  And so I tried to save the dog. And the whole building got swept up into the sky.  And when we landed.  I don't know.  It was weird.  There was this sociopath dressed in tinfoil.  And this really fat cat with anxiety issues and, I don't mean to be rude but this really stupid tramp. And we had to follow this yellow road to find this dude in a green town who would help and he was just a giant fraud.  So the only way I could get home was to kill this new age priestess for her slippers. Fucking Toto. 

### Bringer No. 6

This was a gig in an outhouse essentially at the Boogaloo in Highgate.  Which in this weather wasn't great. And the crowd was weird. One guy got up and did his act and he was followed by this woman who claimed that he'd stolen a joke from her. He said he hadn't.  I suppose it's impossible to know who's telling the truth. Although she did also say as part of her act "If you're not having suicidal thoughts why are you even doing comedy?" Which is probably a bit she shouldn't mention if the beef ever come to trial.

There were some actual punters in the crowd as well.  And some of those (well one of those) was not a nice lady. I was at this gig being bring for a disable person, and when we came back from the toilet in the interval she was sitting in the place we'd been sitting.  When I tried to put my friend back in *his* place she started being horrible to him saying "You have to move up so my husband can sit there." I'm not certain, but I think she was the woman taking exception to an anti Brexit joke early in the set.

### Wednesday January 30th 

### Gig No. 6 - Heavenly Comedy, Princess Victoria

A good gig - as always at Heavenly Comedy.  I'd arranged a bringer so that I could do 10 minutes and then only did about 8 mins 30 secs which was probably a mistake but it was good to give some material a first airing - the fucking Toto stuff.

### Joke No. 13 - Cluedo

I once talked to this guy who was doing research on video games causing violence.  And I said oh, so are you comparing those people to people who play other games - like Rugby? Hang on a minute.  Never mind Rugby.  What about board games. Trivial pursuit? Monoply. Do you know a game of monoply that hasn't ended in a rage quit?

People must get actually killed while playing cluedo so often the forensics guys get bored of seeing it.

"Yes, he's been superficially beaten about the head with the box. And then his head has been slammed repeatedly into the board - that's why the little candlestick and the revolver are embedded in his forhead. And as a simultaneous demonstration of overkill and futility he's been stabbed 43 times in the neck with a tiny, tiny, dagger."

### Tuesday January 29th

### Gig No. 5 - Hoop and Toy
I thought this gig went pretty well.  It's very frustrating that some of this stuff still went best the first time that I did it.  But hey. I'm worried that I'm not writing enough.  

Time to get up first thing in the morning and write some more material.

### Joke No. 12 - The Beach Bit

OK, I'm going to try a bit of guided meditation here for a minute. Just imagine that you're on a beach. It's a beautiful sunny day and the sun is beating down. You can hear the seagulls and the sound of the waves breaking on the shore.  You can feel the sun on your face and the warm water and the sand between your toes.

Now the question is, which is the most vivid? Is it the sight of the sand and the sea? Is it the sound of the waves and the seagulls? Or is it the feel of the sand between your toes and the sun on your face.

If it's blue of the sky and the sunlight, that means you're basically a visual person. If it's the sound of the waves you're an aural person.  Sound. Sound you dirty fuckers.  If you're asking how much this holiday cost and if breakfast is included and why they don't serve baked beans you're my fucking uncle Trevor. No seriously, if it's the feel of the sand between your toes that's most vivid, you're probably a serial killer.

### Joke No. 11 - Prostate exam

I went to get my prostate examined by the doctor.  Because you get to a certain age that's what happens.  The doctor is a tiny young Indian lady and she asks me if I'd like a chaperone.  And I was thinking, yes, that's exactly what this situation needs.  An audience.  

So she did the exam and she said that my prostate was nice and smooth - what's the right response to that? Thank you? Is that in any of the etiquette books?

### Wednesday 23rd January 2019

### Bringer #5 - Strange Brew Comedy, Deptford

I was a bringer for this and the host posted some good pictures of me laughing my ass off. There were a couple of comedians that I liked and what I liked about both of them was their energy.  Note to self.  Always get the names of the comedians that you like. I found the headline act:
* Hilarious
* Reassuring because so much of what he was doing had clearly been *written* - they were actual jokes.

### Tuesday 22nd January 2019

I AM FIFTY TODAY! 

### Joke No. 10 - Unaided Flight

Unaided flight is a thing that birds can do that we humans can't do. Like hanging upsidedown from a bird feeder to get at the peanuts, birds can do it.  Humans can't.  I know - I've tried.


### Sunday 20th January 2019

### Bringer No 4. Rising Stars 
[Rising Stars Comedy Club](https://www.facebook.com/RisingStarComedy/)

The winner of the night - Lucy Gape was very funny and lifted a night that had been a bit lacklustre up to that point.  It's a good room at the King and Queen on Foley street in Fitzrovia. It wasn't quite full, but I can imagine if it were it would be awesome. 

### Joke No 9. Finer points of bringer gig etiquette

I was at an open mic bringer gig a couple of weeks ago and Alastair Campbell's daughter was doing a set. She started out by boasting that she'd bullied someone at school.  Which I thought was a brave move in front of a bunch of comedians. Then her bringer left - halfway through her set and she did 8 minutes instead of eight and then fucked off after her set.  Which I thought was totally out of order, but I suppose if your dad was instrumental in the illegal death of millions of people you're not too worried about the finer points of bringer gig etiquette.

### Saturday 19th January 2019

Ha! I just checked the lyrics of "Africa" by Toto.  And it's not "I guess it rains down in Africa", it's "I bless the rains down in Africa." I don't know if that means I should just not do the bit, or it makes the bit better.

### Friday 18th January 2019

### Joke No. 8 - Fucking Toto

Fucking Toto - "I guess it rains down in Africa." Good fucking guess.  What's it gonna do? Rain up? It's kind of in the definition of rain that it rains down.  That's why it's called precipitation.  If it's raining up.  Either that's plain old evapouration, or maybe it's the end times.

### Joke No. 7 - Wrong routine

Hello.  How are you doing? Look at this! You're here! I'm here! Let's push the tea and bourbons to one side and get fucking.  Ah sorry.  Wrong opening speech.

### Joke No. 6 - World Peace

I would really like world peace.  Actually I don't think world peace isn't enough.  You really need world peace and quiet.  Because if there's world peace but somebody's watching:

* youtube videos
* on their phone
* with the sound on

Sooner or later there's gonna be murders.

### Wednesday 16th January 2019

### Bringer No. 3 - The Cavendish Arms

So I was a bringer at the competition at the Cav the night after I was a competitor.  It was interesting to note that *I* thought that the audience was much better than the previous night.  The comic that I was bringering didn't think they were that great. 

Actually I thought pretty much everyone was hilarious. And I laughed a *lot.*

Some of the people were hilarious were only on their third or fourth gig, which is amazing. And just goes to show that Logan Murray's claim that *everyone* can be funny in the right setting is pretty much true.

A couple of gigs that I did have in the calendar have disappeared.  So I don't have another gig now until I'm over 50!

And I'm seriously thinking about trying to make my next gig entirely new material.  Not reading off a clipboard. But properly hot-housed. I've got 12 days. I think I can do it.

### Joke No. 5 - Fucking How Much?

I love living in London and most of the time I just put up with the prices.  But every now and then I have a Yorkshire flashback. It's like the world goes into slow motion and it "Foooookinnnnngin Hooowwwwwww MUCH?"

And at that point, if I did have a machine gun I would just gun down all the staff.

### Tuesday 15th January 2019

### Gig No. 4 - Cavendish Arms Competition
It went nowhere near as well as the Strange Brew gig last week. I noticed that competition audiences at the Cav are less willing to laugh than normal Cav audiences.

And I didn't get through to the next round. Which felt miserable when it happened. But that's the ying to the yang of how great it feels when they laugh and you totally smash it.

There was also some reference to my age. The compere compared (I suppose that's his job!) me to the old guy from "Up!".  Cheeky bastard. And then my bringer pointed out that there was a strong contrast between me and the other comedians in terms of age. OK.  I'm a lot older than a lot of the other comedians on the circuit, but I still think I have something to give. Part of me wonders if I should vary what I do to somehow fit my age better. Part of me (the part that wins) thinks "fuck it, this is MY time." I'll do what the fuck I like.

I was going to ask the audience what sort of jokes they think I should tell, but I didn't because I thought I should do a *tight* five minutes. But what would have been the harm?

But then, you know, listening back to the recording.  I do sound kind of tired. And I'm sure that that doesn't work.  I know that there are some "low energy" comedians. But I don't think my stuff generally works that way.  The way that I see myself is as friendly, eccentric and OK, filthy. 

And this is good, because it's a note that I can give to myself (as well as the note to always make sure that I record myself and listen back to the recordings). When it's a long old night and you're not on until later, you need to make sure that you attack with energy.

### Stunts

I read a book about the great performer and showman Ken Campbell. He had a lot of success running theatrical shows in the middle of pubs in the Lancashire mill towns. This can be a tough crowd. The way that he did this was by performing something that was a lot nearer street theatre than theatre, for example hammering a six inch nail into someone's nostril (this is apparently a lot easier than it sounds but please don't try this, either at home or in the pub).

My ideas for stunts aren't that outrageous, but if I can any of them to work I might try to think of some more.

1. Make a huge thing of attempting to ask a member of the audience their profession and being genuinely interested in their response.
2. Ask the audience what kinds of jokes they think you're going to tell. Ask them what kinds of jokes they'd like you to tell - try to tell a joke about that.
3. Busking stand-up comedian spend a day in one of the spots where people busk offering to tell jokes for money.  I'm thinking one pound a joke. 5 jokes for three pounds.

### Bringer No. 2 - Cuddles for Troubles 

This is normally a very friendly night but I found it a bit weird. Maybe what made it so weird was that one of the first acts on was the daughter of a famous politician.  She wasn't funny. But she didn't have to be to keep people interested because she was telling stories about famous people. What I found particularly galling was that she didn't obey the rules of the "Bringer" - she didn't stay until the end. And she also did about a minute and a half longer than she was supposed to.

Ah well, I suppose if your dad's implicated in murdering a million people you're probably not going to "sweat" the small stuff of the etiquette of a bringer night.

The other thing that slightly bothered me was that there were two female comedians who did stuff that, I thought, was really hostile to men. One of them was specifically calling out men my age. Part of what bothers me about it is that I'm wondering if when I do jokes about sex, I'm coming across as hostile to women. I've theorised that it might be a good idea to "punch up" as a female comedian.  So it's interesting that when I watched someone do that a couple of times in one night, I didn't like it up me - as Clive Dunn would say. 

One of the jokes that I did like was "I went to therapy, then I did stand-up comedy, which is definitely the right order." A lot of people are there to talk about their sexuality in ways which are quite near therapy.  

I mean. *I'm* there when I'm on stage to talk about my sexuality.  But I suppose what I'm trying to do is to have put enough work into the writing and the delivery that it gets laughs. Could you (if you were a woman) do a routine about hating men that was riotously funny?

I read autobiography of Joan Rivers and she says something about it being OK for there to be hate in the comedy.  But there has to be more comedy than hate.

A brand new comedy gig in Deptford. The compere asked me what kind of material I was going to do. Me "Erm, I'm going to talk about Brexit and oral sex."

I was supposed to be second on in the second act (a very nice slot) but then some other comics didn't turn up and I ended up being on first! I'd only just though of the oral sex stuff that morning and I did it instead of the LME stuff which hasn't really gone that well. And, it went very well. I wouldn't necessarily say that I smashed it (OK I did say that on facebook!) but it went very well.

I think the hot housing worked very well. I'm going to try to do some more tomorrow.

### Joke No. 4

### Oral sex

>>Lots of things sound like a great idea but turn out to be a bad idea.  I read a book about oral sex. No this is real.  It's called "She comes first." And it was lots of good advice about oral sex. Cover the whole area.  Not just the top bit.  Maintain eye contact.  Which can be tricky. But yes.  Good.  Compliment  her on the smell and the taste.

>> Now this just goes to show that in sex, as in comedy, timing is very important.  Because at this point, compliment a lady on the smell of her vagina is a good idea.  Do it to someone you've never met before on the Jubilee line? You're gonna get funny looks.  See? Timing. 

>> But finally, when you're getting advance it suggests that you get right in there and put your big front teeth against the clitoris and hum. You're essentially turning yourself into a giant vibrator.  Sounds like a good idea right? But the question then arises.  What are you gonna hum? I always want to hum the damnbusters. You've got the mask on.  You've got things flapping in the wind behind you.

>>I was not popular.  This gives a whole new meaning to the phrase "not going down well."

### Gig Notes - Gig No. 2 
Great gig in Stoke Newington - 42 Comedy club on a Tuesday night downstairs at Fanny's bar.

You know when you go to the theatre and you come back all breathless and enthusiastic.  That's how I feel after this gig.  I really think the hot-housing worked.

I did a *bunch* of material I've never done before about Brexit and Sinn Fein! And it got laughs in front of a substantially Irish crowd.

I really didn't think that the place looked like much when I went in there but I enjoyed being in the audience and *boy* did I enjoy being on stage.

Again.  Again.

Great gig in Stoke Newington - 42 Comedy club on a Tuesday night downstairs at Fanny's bar.

### Knob Gags

Knob gags. Dick gags. Ball gags. I wrote down the "curler" joke from yesterday, even though it was tortuous because I think it's important even to write down a glimmer of a gag. But at the same time I'd really like to write some other jokes. 

### Joke No. 4

### You are what you eat

They say that you are what you eat.  Does that mean that Boris Johnson eats massive cocks?

### Bringer No. 1 - Cavendish Arms Comedy Competition, "the Max Turner"

Interesting to go a comedy competition.  There was one stand-out act, who I'm sure I'll see again and catch his name next time - Nick someone.
  
One thing that *is* clear about that competition is that getting on first is really bad. The first three or four acts really struggled.

I'm on next week and I can see that what you need for that competition is a really tight set.  Which is exactly what I don't have. 

### Joke No. 3

### Curlers

I have this friend who's into polyamoury.  I rang her up last night on the off-chance she wanted to go out for a drink.

She said "Oh I would do, but I just got the curlers in."

I said "You mean you're doing your hair."

She said "No that's what I call my boyfriends Jeff and Barry."

I said "Why?"

She said "Because they sweep me up and they've got huge stones."


## January 5th 2019

### Joke No. 2

### A Year of Living Self-Helpfully

**Planuary** - plan all the things that you're going to stop doing in the rest of the year

**Forbrewery** - got to the pub every night 

**Fartz** - eat a *lot* of kebabs and curries

**Staypril** - stay in the house and watch box sets, order pizza

**Play away May** - commit adultery 

**Noon June** - don't get out of bed until lunch

**July** - Ju lie next to the pool somewhere sunny probably drinking cocktails with a hangover

**Or Gust** - a lot like Fartz

**Acceptember** - say yes to everything
**Cocktober** – Behave like Piers Morgan

**NoNovember** - don't say “no” to anything

**Dick-cember** - pretend to be a vegan, especially for Christmas dinner.

### Notes on "Hot-housing"

OK, so I played the game with the speed of the routine yesterday and it kind of worked.

Some notes.

1. There are only really three speeds: slow as you can bear, fast as you can and normal (it might work to go slow and then try to go slower and then try to go even slower, and the same with faster).
2. It teaches you the material and it makes you feel the bits that don't work
3. I think I've got about 2 mins tops of good stuff in my current 5 mins so I need to write some more!
4. I got a "weak joke" out of the activity - "50 years old and never been swiped."

### "Hot-housing"

Just realised that I've got a competition in 12 days time.  And what I need for that is a "tight" 5 minutes.  That's not what I have have the the moment is a "loose" 9 or 10 minutes. How do I make it tighter. Well, I can do *lots* of 5 minute gigs but every one that I do, I have to go to.  And that's typically a whole evening that I'm not at home.  Also, every gig that I do where I'm saying the *same* thing over and over is a gig where I'm not trying new material.  It's also a gig where I'm not trying new interactions with audience. 

So I've got an idea for something that I might try.

1. Put together 5 minutes of material.
1. Read it through a couple of times and time it.
2. Print it out.
3. Get a dice (die I believe is the singular).
4. Roll it:
*	1 = VERY SLOW
*	2 = QUITE SLOW
*	3 = NORMAL SPEED
*	4 = QUITE FAST
*	5 = CRAZY FAST
*	6 = OPERATIC/RAP/AS IF IT WERE POETRY
5. Do this 5 or 6 times - video it.
6. After each iteration make notes of any new funny ideas that came to you, any changes you might make.  Either note them on the routine or, if you're getting to the point where you're putting the routine down just add them in.
7. I'm going to try this this weekend, I might post the results.

### Joke No. 1 of the year

>> I think it's time ladies and gentlemen that we talk about the elephant in the room, well, if there isn't an elephant in the room, what did I just see in the gents?  Not only had it blocked the u-bend it had cracked the pot. And there was what looked like a trunk-shaped dent in the wall.  Although I suppose it's possible that that was the result of veganuary.

### Gig Notes - Gig No. 1

There weren't many of us last night at the Princess Victoria in Shepherd's Bush.  Njambi McGrath runs a great evening, but it's *not* a bringer unless you want to do 10 minutes (I'd bought a bringer). 

There was one joke that I really liked about millenials, which I won't share here.

OK, this is a weird thing.  When you go to a stand-up gig, there's a *lot* to remember.

* Engage with the audience rather than just look down at your material - I managed that a bit
* Video your performance (totally forgot)
* Remember the names of the comedians that you think are funny.

I've thought of doing a few things about my name just so that people would remember it, my mum is a shrewd Yorkshire woman, so I got 4 letters, no middle name.  Mark. The other thing about this name is that it's very easy to shout.  Mark.  It's a lot like BARK.  The result of this is that she perfected a way of saying it that could make me jump straight out of bed and into my clothes on a school morning. MARK!

I've also thought of writing my name on my T-shirt (then there would be another thing that I had to remember - to take off my clothes under the t-shirt).

### Not a Good Start

So I printed out a routine that I did before Christmas.  None of it looks funny. I've added a joke about the elephant in the room.  That doesn't look funny either.

I have a gig booked for tonight "The Heavenly Comedy" at the Princess Victoria in Shepherds Bush.  I didn't sleep very well and me being awake woke up my wife up, and she had to get up early, when we both finally did wake up we had an argument. So new year is of to a roaring start!

I'd really rather I didn't do this gig tonight, but I've arranged a bringer (if I have a bringer I get a whole 10 minutes) and I don't want to let the organiser, NJambi McGrath down.
