# Mark Stringer Comedy 

**This a record of my attempt to perform 50 open mic comedy gigs in 2019.  I also want to write 180 jokes (3 jokes a minute? hey! that's a one hour show).  I want to laugh a lot - and who knows? Maybe make somebody else laugh as well.**

## Not a Good Start

So I printed out a routine that I did before Christmas.  None of it looks funny. I've added a joke about the elephant in the room.  That doesn't look funny either.

I have a gig booked for tonight "The Heavenly Comedy" at the Princess Victoria in Shepherd's bush.  I didn't sleep very well and me being awake woke up my wife up, and she had to get up early, when we both finally did wake up we had an argument. So new year is of to a roaring start!

I'd really rather I didn't do this gig tonight, but I've arranged a bringer (if I have a bringer I get a whole 10 minutes) and I don't want to let the organiser, NJambi McGrath down.
