# Mark Stringer Comedy 

**This a record of my attempt to perform 50 open mic comedy gigs in 2019.  I also want to write 180 jokes (3 jokes a minute? hey! that's a one hour show).  I want to laugh a lot - and who knows? Maybe make somebody else laugh as well.**

### "Hothousing"

Just realised that I've got a competition in 12 days time.  And what I need for that is a "tight" 5 minutes.  That's not what I have have the the moment is a "loose" 9 or 10 minutes. How do I make it tighter. Well, I can do *lots* of 5 minute gigs but every one that I do, I have to go to.  And that's typically a whole evening that I'm not at home.  Also, every gig that I do where I'm saying the *same* thing over and over is a gig where I'm not trying new material.  It's also a gig where I'm not trying new interactions with audience. 

So I've got an idea for something that I might try.

1) Put together 5 minutes of material. Read it through a couple of times and time it.

2) Print it out.

3) Get a dice (die I believe is the singular).

4) Roll it:
	1 = VERY SLOW
	2 = QUITE SLOW
	3 = NORMAL SPEED
	4 = QUITE FAST
	5 = CRAZY FAST
	6 = OPERATIC/RAP/AS IF IT WERE POETRY

5) Do this 5 or 6 times - video it.

6) After each iteration make notes of any new funny ideas that came to you, any changes you might make.  Either note them on the routine or, if you're getting to the point where you're putting the routine down just add them in.

7) I'm going to try this this weekend, I might post the results.

### First Joke of the year

>> I think it's time ladies and gentlemen that we talk about the elephant in the room, well, if there isn't an elephant in the room, what did I just see in the gents?  Not only had it blocked the u-bend it had cracked the pot. And there was what looked like a trunk-shaped dent in the wall.  Although I suppose it's possible that that was the result of veganuary.

### Gig Notes - Gig Number 1

There weren't many of us last night at the Princess Victoria in Shepherd's Bush.  Njambi McGrath runs a great evening, but it's *not* a bringer unless you want to do 10 minutes (I'd bought a bringer). 

There was one joke that I really liked about millenials, which I won't share here.

OK, this is a weird thing.  When you go to a stand-up gig, there's a *lot* to remember.

* Engage with the audience rather than just look down at your material - I managed that a bit
* Video your performance (totally forgot)
* Remember the names of the comedians that you think are funny.

I've thought of doing a few things about my name just so that people would remember it, my mum is a shrewd Yorkshire woman, so I got 4 letters, no middle name.  Mark. The other thing about this name is that it's very easy to shout.  Mark.  It's a lot like BARK.  The result of this is that she perfected a way of saying it that could make me jump straight out of bed and into my clothes on a school morning. MARK!

I've also thought of writing my name on my T-shirt (then there would be another thing that I had to remember - to take off my clothes under the t-shirt).

### Not a Good Start

So I printed out a routine that I did before Christmas.  None of it looks funny. I've added a joke about the elephant in the room.  That doesn't look funny either.

I have a gig booked for tonight "The Heavenly Comedy" at the Princess Victoria in Shepherds Bush.  I didn't sleep very well and me being awake woke up my wife up, and she had to get up early, when we both finally did wake up we had an argument. So new year is of to a roaring start!

I'd really rather I didn't do this gig tonight, but I've arranged a bringer (if I have a bringer I get a whole 10 minutes) and I don't want to let the organiser, NJambi McGrath down.
