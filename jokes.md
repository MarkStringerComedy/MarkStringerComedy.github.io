## Growing up in a shithole

Lots of people say that they grew up in a shithole - and I think they're sort of wrong and they're sort of right. See I don't think it's the place. Yorkshire, rural Somerset, East London, wherever. I don't think it's the place. I think it's childhood.  Childhood is the shithole.

You have no money, you have no control and you're entirely financially and emotionally dependent on these grownups for whom you're an emotional and financial drain. And when you're an adult you, well at lease to some degree you have control over who you hang around with. When you're a kid it's your family and other schoolkids. And other schoolkids are like most people. Most people are fucking awful. When you're a grown up you can avoid most people. You can stick to the ones that you like.

## Joke No. 81

Everybody's getting excited about a sex robot.

Tell you when I'll get excited, when there's a *relationship* robot. That would be some fucking clever AI. 

Yeah you can make a robot that can lie there and think of Silicon Valley, go ooh ahh. I want a robot that when my wife comes to me with two swatches for curtain material, can pick the right one. You haven't got that yet Zuckerberg. You fucking haven't. 

I want a robot that perks up when it here's 

"What's wrong"
"No, nothing"

I want a robot that right in my ear goes "Dude! There's something wrong. You'd better find out what you've done. Right now!"


## Joke No. 80
For me, Brexit is like waking up with the worst hangover I've ever had. The worst hangover I've ever had was in freshers week at university. I don't really remember much about the night before, but we were drinking things called "Pan galactic gargle blasters" - it was the eighties, it was Green and it came in a pint glass.

And the morning after, I woke up, and realised I'd thrown up over nearly half of my bed and so I tried to move away from it and then realised that I'd shat all over almost all of the other half. And so what I did was curl up into a smaller foetal shape, in the tiny sliver of my bed that wasn't covered in diarhhoea or vomit and went back to sleep. 

That's how I currently feel about Brexit. At some point Britain is going to have to clear all this up.

At some point Britain is going to have to go downstairs, ask the bursar for a clean set of sheets - and a new mattress. And then go in to breakfast with all of the people who saw you being carried horizontally into your room the night before shouting "I'm a little teapot suck my spout!" At the bursor. 

And then maybe two weeks later your room mate, who's a six foot skinhead from Watford is going to come home one night similarly inebriated and try to bugger who - sticking with this as a Brexit metaphor, I think that's Russia.

## Joke No. 79
You know when you go back to home and nobody's updated your mum's PC and it's caught loads of viruses?

That's what it feels like sometimes when you're talking to friends now.

## Joke No. 78
Laugh and the world laughs with you.

Ha, ha, ha! Apparently not.

## Joke No. 77 

It takes two to Tango - and a minimum of six plus a fool for Morris dancing.

## Joke No. 76
Americans different names for things. Courgette - zucchini. Aubergine - egg plant. What they call Rutabaga, is what we'd call a Swede - if we didn't call him Sven.

### Joke No. 75 
Where the best place to hide a sociopath with daddy issues? An open mic comedy night!

### Joke No. 74
Whenever I travel wherever I go, as I tiny rebellion when I'm in the hotel room I pee in my kettle.

I know, I know it's crazy. But I take that kettle with me everywhere.

It makes the best tea. 


### Weak Joke Hospital

Dr dr - I think I have diabetes. 

I'm sorry - you're going to die because there's no insulin.

Dr dr, every time I Brexit the economy dips by the equivalent of the 1929 crash.

Well don't Brexit then.

### Joke No. 73 
And it got me thinking about games that end when you shout something out. Bingo - "Bingo", obvs. Sometimes "House". Hide and seek? "Olly Olly Oxenfree" - apparently. Mornington Crescent? Mornington Crescent - if you no what I'm talking bout. 

And sex "Ha ha oh? Oh, I'm sorry."

### Joke No. 72
Tombola of course - you can tell when you hear it in Italian is what you shout out when you've filled your Bingo card.

Brexit is what you shout out as a country when you've filled your nappy.

### Joke No. 71
I've been really impressed by the way the Italians pronounce the word "tombola" - "TOMbola" - that's better isn't it? 

It got me thinking, maybe other words, if you pronounce them correctly, you can learn to love them. Like Brexit. See the Italian way to prounce that is "Fascism".

### Joke No. 70
I was in a band for a while when I was a teenager. Then we became an a capella group after we left our instruments on a bus.

### Joke No. 69
I got so fat I wasn't really wearing clothes, more landscape tayloring.

### Joke No. 68
Women exhibit sexual plasticity - which is to say that after a certain age they prefer a vibrator.

As they say. To err is human. To whirr is divine.

### Joke No. 67
You that feeling you get when you're really attracted to someone. When you start to feel butterflies in your stomach. Your mouth kind of falls open in anticipation, your eyes widen, even your nostrils flare so that you can breath in their perfume. Well that's what happens to me when I see a pie.

### Joke No. 66

I think if we've learned anything in the three years since the referendum it's that if we could only come together as a country and be a little bit more racist.  A lot of our problems would be solved.

### Joke No. 65
Red sky at night. I told you not to let me play with matches.

Red sky at morning.  This isn't really a time of day sensitive thing. Just don't give me any matches.

The ash before the oak and we will have a soak. The oak before the ask and we will get a mop-topped Etonian fuckwit Fash as prime minister.

The horse chestnut before the sycamore and she will never touch your dickamore.

The the sycamore before the horse chestnut. She's still not touching your dick. This is has got nothing to do with deciduous woodland.

### Joke no. 64
We all come from a shit hole. Well, near a shit hole. We all come from a vagina. 

What would Freud say about that joke? Well, if the most profound question of your whole career was "What do women want?" I think we can safely guess that the answer was "Not you Ziggy."

### Joke no. 63 
### Weak joke hospital 
Have you ever seen a job description for a blow job?

### Joke No. 62a
I really love the wall in my garden. See it goes up vertically for about 6 feet then it goes horizontally for about 6 inches. Then it goes up vertically for another couple of feet.  What a ledge!

### Joke No. 62
I can't talk about football.  It's like not being able to speak bloke.  When I get in a black cab, to be honest, I'd rather the taxi driver talks about racism rather than about football. At least then I can have an opinion.

### Joke No. 61

I find incest porn really [pause] uninspiring.

Jesus guys - aren't your christmases awkward enough? 

### Joke No. 60

A naked egg (recently separated) walks into a bar and the barman says - "Is this some kind of yoke"?

## Joke No. 59
[Elephant in the room] I used to do that bit because I used to be genuinely confused about what you find in the gents sometimes.  Then I took a course of wide spectrum antibiotics. I must admit, I have fled the scene of some of the things that I've done while taking those fuckers. 

They're building a super sewer from the centre of london, it runs 20 miles to the sewage works in Beckton in East London. Some people who are saying why do we need a super sewer that doubles the capacity of London's sewerage system? Why? Because three people in central London are taking wide spectrum anti-biotics, that's why. 

Wide spectrum anti biotic turd - or WiSABIT versus fatberg.  You do NOT want to see that movie. Turdzilla versus the blob. 

### Joke No. 58
When you find a lump on your balls - that's an unexpected item in shagging area.
Actually I'm fifty, who am I kidding - unexpected item in saggin area

#### Weak joke hospital
Unexpected item in gagging area (something to do with oral sex).

### Joke No. 57
Friedriech Nietzsche said that when you look into the void, the void looks into you. But in Yorkshire, when you look into the void, the void says "what are you fucking looking at?"

### Weak joke hospital
I had a fake cake at my wedding.

### Joke No. 56 - Curly wurly

Do you know what really straightens my curly wurly?

### Joke No. 55 - Eye contact and self-help bit

So I'm just going to take a moment to make eye contact with some of the audience. I'm reading a self-help book at the moment about the importance of eye contact. Ever wonder about that phrase "self-help." If you could help yourself.  Well, then you wouldn't need help. It's even worse if it's a diet book. I need to lose weight. Helping myself is what got me into this situation.

It's about as much use as my buying a self-dress book. I'm self-aware.  I know I can't dress myself. Ok I can put my trousers on and tie my shoe laces like a big boy, but I can't, no matter what I do, I can't manage to look like I didn't just stagger up an embankment after a train crash, in the 1990's.  I think it might have been Potters bar. 

### Joke No. 54 - Physalis
You know when you go to a *moderately* fancy restaurant, with your dessert you sometimes get this little yellow fruit - with like curly leaves.  Do you know what that's called? I didn't and then I did some research that's millenial y'know for typing something into Google. 

It's called Physalis. I'm not surprised the don't shout about what it's called.

### Joke No. 53 - Worst thing you've ever eaten

You madam.  What's the worst thing you've ever eaten? Was it this guy?

### Joke No. 52 - #metoo

I'm totally on board with #metoo.  I don't want anybody to do anything that they don't want to do. And I realise that for most women, when it comes to things that they don't want to do, I'm right at the top of the list.

### Joke #51 - Japanese prison camp sex

Yes, I'm stil getting sex.  But I've been with my wife 25 years.  I'm getting sex, like you get food in a World War Two Japanese prison camp. Just at the point when I'm about to drop into a coma. I'm fed a little gruel.

### Weak joke hospital

* I might be an idiot. I see a lot of younger people talking about some particular stupid thing that they've done. I'm 50. I've got files. I've got a CV. 

* I see a lot of open mic female comedians saying that they're single and that they really want to have sex with a man. But I don't think they mean me. 


### Weak Joke Hospital
Bury your hopes and dreams under the patio - with all the relatives you didn't like.
Sweat shirts? No other kind of clothing gets named after bodily effluvia.  Cum pants? Shit socks? Sputum miniskirts.


### Joke No. 50 - Jesus was a stand-up comedian
But was Jesus a stand-up comedian? He had a pretty weird relationship with his father - my dad, right, he didn't love me, but not only did he not love me, he nailed me to a cross to show my step brothers and sisters how he loved them more.. He spent most of his time with 12 other losers who didn't have jobs just sat around talking about how they were going to be famous. 

Went they went to the wedding at Canaa they all ordered jugs of tap water.

There was this ex-hooker who joined them thinking it might be a good career change. True story. When he'd died pretty much the worst death EVER - he crawled away, hid in a cave for three days and came out and did another gig.

### Joke No. 49 - Financial Advice

He who goes a-borrowing, goes a-sorrowing.

I think all financial advice should rhyme. (OK, needs more work).

People who invest unwisely in complex financial instruments 
might find they spend a large chunk of their lives living in tents?

Shakespeare said neither a borrower nor a lender be for borrowing dulls the end of husbandry.

I think this means that if you're worrying about your financial problems, it's difficult to maintain an erection.

### Joke No. 48
There's no time like the present - and actually there's no present like time.  Although it's a fucker to wrap. 

### Joke No. 47 - What Makes you Laugh or Smile
This is new material.  What they say is if it makes you laugh or smile, it's probably worth trying out in front of an audience. Good advice. Doesn't apply to your own penis.  That's what the police told me.

### Joke No. 46 - Sexual Fantasies
Everybody understands there's difference between sexual fantasies and sexual realities don't they?

If my sexual fantasies were realities I'd have to have a gallon of yoghurt and a brick of zinc for breakfast.

### Joke No. 46 - Surprise Parties
Now you may think that it would be great to know everything through all time. But it does have some drawbacks.  God knew that Bruce Willis was seeing dead people right at the beginning of that movie.

You can't play a game of patience.  And nobody's going to play poker with you.

And never, since the beginning of time has anyone thrown you a surprise party.

### Joke No. 45 - Lovely audience
I've been listen to you guys.  I think you're a lovely audience. Lovely. But very discerning. You seem to be sitting there saying "Mmm, I'm only going to laugh at an observation that uniquely captures the tragi-comic nature of the human condition." That or a really good knob gag.

### Joke No. 44 (addition bit for "Now THAT's what I call music")
One of the unexpected effects of losing weight for me has been that I've started to get "morning wood" again - for the first time since my 20's. 

It's like finding something really unexpected from the 80's in your pants, like a "Now that's what I call music 3" audio cassette in your pants. And my wife said - it would have been even more surprising if it were a 12 inch and black.

### Joke No. 43 (it's a bit really)
Weak Joke Hospital

This is a bit where I read you out my weakest, barely alive, feeding them milk through a pipette even though they're not mammals and the lactose will probably kill them, jokes.

And together we try to decide if they're any hope of them recovering, flapping their wings and making it into a comedy routine, or should we put them in a cloth sack and drop them in the Thames. 

### Joke No. 42 - No Ath
This is what athleisure wear looks like if you don't do any ath.

\[Dirty version of that joke that I can probably never use\]

Ass leisure wear.  Anybody who is wearing assleisure were is either inadvertently or advertently telling you just how much fun their ass would me. 

### Joke No. 41 
Just a bit about me.  This bit. \[points to bit of chest\] This bit is about me. This bit? \[points around\] This bit is around me.  That bit? \[points far away\] That's beyond me.

You know when people say.  It's not all about you. That's totally wrong isn't it.  Because apart from what I had for lunch and some internal organs.  Literally everything else is about me.

Some prepositional humour there.

Don't worry - there'll be someone along complaining about Tinder in about 4 minutes.

### Joke No. 41
I think I know you're all optimists who see the positive aspects of any situation. 

How do I know this? If you look back at the times you've had the most fun, if you remember the times when you've been happiest - my guess is they weren't in comedy clubs.

And yet here you are. See that's optimism.

### Joke No. 40 - Spice Girls

I had this nightmare.  There was this terrifying monster coming to get me. And I could see that it had eight legs and I thought, no actually I knew it was the Kraken.  But then I counted more carefully and realised that it had ten legs and five vaginas.  It was the Spice Girls.

And so they asked me to tell them what I wanted, what I really wanted. And I said a kitkat.  And they said we're all out of kitkats how about a Twix? And I said hmmph. Alright then. 

Then Emma Bunton gave me a sparkly look and they fucked off on a union jack double decker bus.  That should have been the giveaway.

### Joke No. 39 

I was doing this gig in a really rough pub last week.  There were these locals at the bar. They were giving me really mean looks. And I don't scare easily.  Sorry.  What am I talking about. I scare really easily. 

### Joke No. 38

And that's why we say "You can't make an omelette without breaking legs." - Ah - sorry, wrong speech - that's just the end of my talk on Mary Berry's martial arts course: Dùn tāng de fāngshì - way of the blunt spoon.  You don't spend 10 years standing next to a Scouser and keep your jewellery without knowing a thing or two about defending yourself with kitchen implements.

Yeah that's right. It's just a basic joke about people from Liverpool being criminals dressed up in a cultural reference and a twinset and pearls. 

### Joke No. 37 Bermuda Triangle
As part of the oral sex humming bit? Bermuda triangle, by Barry Manilow?


### Joke No. 36 A

A coward dies a thousand times a comedian, nearly as much.

### Joke No. 36 Comfort Zone
I like comedy.  It pushes me outside of my comfort zone.  And to be clear my comfort zone is sitting at home watching an episode of Poirot where I can't remember who the murder is, while asking my wife "what's wrong" and she's still not so drunk that she's actually going to tell me.

### Joke No. 35 - Brian Blessed

Blessed are the peacemakers - Jesus said that.  Except Brian Blessed.  He's really loud.  Jesus didn't say that. But he could have, because you see Jesus is God on earth.  And God is omniscient he knows everything across all of space and time.  So when Jesus was delivering the sermon on the mount, he was aware - even though he was talking in Aramaic, he was aware that there'd be pun in the English translation.  But he didn't go for it.
But then, I suppose Jesus isn't really a stand-up comedian - he's more of a hang-up tragedian. 

### Joke No. 34 -  Millenials

Millenials? Eh? Who are they? Nobody seems to know.  People who've been born since the year 2000 people who've never know a world without the internet? People who like making hats? That's a niches artisanal craft pun there. Because people who like making hats are called milliners.

They like drinking mud don't they? They all seem to be carrying around plastic bottles filled with mud.  Huel. A food that not only looks the same going down as it does coming back up, but sounds the same as well. Do you know what I find weirdest? The Christmas dinner version? Liquidised turkey sprouts and all the trimmings.  Including pudding.  Yule Huel.

And they, and by they I mean most you. Like putting their feet on the seats don't they? Why is that? Do you do that in your own house? Oh, sorry you don't own one do you. Is that what it is?  I don't have a sofa to call my own, I shall soil all the public ones.

And tights.  Everybody is wearing tights. Men are wearing tights. Women are wearing tights. 

### Joke No. 33 - Psychotic episode

I this new material or a psychotic episode? Probably too early to tell.

### Joke No. 32 - Shots Fired

Shh! What's that? Shots fired. \[Sniffs elaborately\] Baileys? Absinthe, Feuerzangenbowle lit with a petrol-fuelled Zippo lighter. Old school! What's that? \[Sniffs again\] the tears of Victorian children corporeally punished for even the slightest disciplinary lapse? Very old school.

### Joke No. 31 -  Weirdest thing
What's the weirdest thing you've got into trouble for doing *while* you're having sex?
I got in a lot of trouble for answering general knowledge questions on Radio 4's Brain of Britain.

### Joke No. 30 - Bee holder
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Honey is in the hive of the bee-holder 

### Joke No. 29 - Now that's what I call Music
When I lost weight something very strange happened - I started to get morning wood again. Which hadn't happened since I was in my early 20's.  It was a real surprise to find something I hadn't seen since the 80's in my pants.  Like finding Now That's What I Call Music Volume 3 in there on cassette.

### Joke No. 28 - Heckler put down.

What was that you said? What? What? Can't hear you.
Now you're talking! And I really wish you wouldn't.

### Joke No. 27 -  Brexit forever

They say that all good things come to an end.  Which is why I know that Brexit will go on for fucking ever.

### Joke No. 26 - You've Been Framed

My advice is never attempt any activity that you've seen go horribly wrong on You've Been Framed.

Trampolining. Roller skating.  Marriage.

### Joke No. 25 - Netflix Death check

Have ever watched so much Netflix that Netflix thinks it needs to check if you're dead? You know - it pops up that little window?
"Are you still watching Netflix?" You appear to have been watching Silent Witness for 42 straight episodes.  If you are doing that to spank off to Emilia Fox - you probably need some fluids.

### Joke No. 24

It's always darkest just before the Dawn.  That's what we say in my family.  Because Dawn is huge.  She blocks out the light.

### Joke No. 23 - Plasticity

Men's sexuality is fixed pretty early in life. Women's sexuality is more fluid.  This is called erotic plasticity.  It means that after certain age woman prefer a vibrator.

No, no.  It means that even though women might have been straight all their lives they still might decide might find later in life that they actually are more attracted to women. 

### Joke No. 22 - Wittgenstein

The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein said that we are all asleep, but sometimes we are awake enough to know that we are dreaming. That's not an announcement you want to hear from the cockpit is it?

Are we even gonna make it to Benidorm?

### Joke No. 21 - Ailments

I thought I'd just talk about my ailments for a bit - because I know that that's really sexy. Especially genito-urinary ailments - that's the hot stuff isn't it?

### Joke No. 20 - More Elephant in the room

You see the Elephant in the room is an interesting idea because it's obviously insane.  There is no Elephant in the room. If there were an elephant in this room, that would be a complete disaster, it would be mayhem.  I was at gig just recently when somebody brought a pit bull to an open mic gig.  That was bad enough.

Actually having an elephant in this room would be disastrous.  But suggesting that there could be - that's easy. I just did it.  And once you've suggested an idea, no matter how crazy.  There are some people who think - "OK - why not?"

And that's why we have Brexit.

### Joke No. 18 - Favourite Pronouns
So some people have started putting their preferred pronouns in their twitter profiles.  And I'm totally fine with that.  Refer to yourself however you want, make it easier for people to address you as you want to be addressed.  Totally fine.  But I was thinking that I don't really mind what pronouns you use for me "he him his."  "They, them, their", "It it its."  Who am I kidding I'm a comedian my preferred pronouns are I, I, I and ME, ME, ME.

But I was thinking I definitely have a preferred noun.  Pudding. 

### Joke No. 17 - (audience bit) 
Good evening madam - do you identify as a woman? Can I ask you is there any possibility of you initiating a sexual encounter with me? What no? That's fine.  You're in control of this thing. I totally respect that.

### Joke No. 16 - Hull is Other People

What if you were in Hell - who would be there with you? In my case, I was imagining that it would be a very beautiful woman who won't sleep with me.  My mum.  Somebody who's a lot cleverer than me and a total racist idiot.  And if life really is a sick joke, what about hell being living with these people in Hull?  What kind of joke is worse than a pun?

### Joke No. 15 - Fucking Tutu

No I actually like being married. And I love my wife. I don't know did I break some basic comedy rule.  But actually getting married was complicated a bit by the injuries from my stag night.

Hey, it wasn't their fault really I suppose.  But my mates thought it would be funny to dress me up in a skirt and tights. And I'm not that used to wearing that kind of gear.  So we were waiting to go up in the life to Sushi Samba in Heron Tower - I know, classy. And my skirt got kind of stuck in the lift and it pulled me off the ground and then it was starting to cut through my skin and if one of my friends hadn't had the initiative to whip out his swiss army knife and cut me out of it, I might have been killed.  But unfortunately by that time, I had been pulled by the skirt to the top of the lift door, so when he did cut me free, I kind of plummeted down and smack my head on the floor.  So that was pretty much an end to the stag night and I was in a cast for my wedding.

Fucking Tutu.

### Joke No. 14 - Fucking Toto Number 2

So I took a break from comedy for a while and I was living and working in Kansas.  In a part of America they call "Tornado alley."

And one day while I was sitting in my studio apartment.  The tornado alarm went off, and I could actually see the thing like a giant plughole in the sky.  So I was running towards the underground car park that was the tornado shelter.  But just as I got to safety this cute little dog ran the other way - back into the apartment building.  And so I tried to save the dog. And the whole building got swept up into the sky.  And when we landed.  I don't know.  It was weird.  There was this sociopath dressed in tinfoil.  And this really fat cat with anxiety issues and, I don't mean to be rude but this really stupid tramp. And we had to follow this yellow road to find this dude in a green town who would help and he was just a giant fraud.  So the only way I could get home was to dissolve this new age priestess so I could get her slippers. Fucking Toto. 

### Joke No. 13 - Cluedo
I once talked to this guy who was doing research on video games causing violence.  And I said oh, so are you comparing those people to people who play other games - like Rugby? Hang on a minute.  Never mind Rugby.  What about board games. Trivial pursuit? Monoply. Do you know a game of monoply that hasn't ended in a rage quit?

People must get actually killed while playing cluedo so often the forensics guys get bored of seeing it.

"Yes, he's been superficially beaten about the head with the box. And then his head has been slammed repeatedly into the board - that's why the little candlestick and the revolver are embedded in his forehead. And as a simultaneous demonstration of overkill and futility he's been stabbed 43 times in the neck with a tiny, tiny, dagger."

### Joke No. 12 - The Beach Bit
Now the question is, which is the most vivid? Is it the sight of the sand and the sea? Is it the sound of the waves and the seagulls? Or is it the feel of the sand between your toes and the sun on your face.

If it's blue of the sky and the sunlight, that means you're basically a visual person. If it's the sound of the waves you're an aural person.  Sound. Sound you dirty fuckers.  If you're asking how much this holiday cost and if breakfast is included and why they don't serve baked beans you're my fucking uncle Trevor. No seriously, if it's the feel of the sand between your toes that's most vivid, you're probably a serial killer.

### Joke No. 11 - Prostate exam

I went to get my prostate examined by the doctor.  Because you get to a certain age that's what happens.  The doctor is a tiny young Indian lady and she asks me if I'd like a chaperone.  And I was thinking, yes, that's exactly what this situation needs.  An audience.  

So she did the exam and she said that my prostate was nice and smooth - what's the right response to that? Thank you? Is that in any of the etiquette books?

### Joke No. 10 - Unaided Flight

Unaided flight is a thing that birds can do that we humans can't do. Like hanging upsidedown from a bird feeder to get at the peanuts, birds can do it.  Humans can't.  I know - I've tried.

### Fucking Toto # 2

Ha! I just checked the lyrics of "Africa" by Toto.  And it's not "I guess it rains down in Africa", it's "I bless the rains down in Africa." I don't know if that means I should just not do the bit, or it makes the bit better.

### Fucking Toto

Fucking Toto - "I guess it rains down in Africa." Good fucking guess.  What's it gonna do? Rain up? It's kind of in the definition of rain that it rains down.  That's why it's called precipitation.  If it's raining up.  Either that's plain old evapouration, or maybe it's the end times.

### Joke No. 7 - Wrong routine

Hello.  How are you doing? Look at this! You're here! I'm here! Let's push the tea and bourbons to one side and get fucking.  Ah sorry.  Wrong opening speech.

### Joke No. 6 - World Peace

I would really like world peace.  Actually I don't think world peace isn't enough.  You really need world peace and quiet.  Because if there's world peace but somebody's watching:

* youtube videos
* on their phone
* with the sound on
* on the tube

Sooner or later there's gonna be murders.


### Fucking How Much?

I love living in London and most of the time I just put up with the prices.  But every now and then I have a Yorkshire flashback. It's like the world goes into slow motion and it "Foooookinnnnngin Hooowwwwwww MUCH?"

And at that point, if I did have a machine gun I would just gun down all the staff.

### Stunts
My ideas for stunts aren't that outrageous, but if I can any of them to work I might try to think of some more.

1. Make a huge thing of attempting to ask a member of the audience their profession and being genuinely interested in their response.
2. Ask the audience what kinds of jokes they think you're going to tell. Ask them what kinds of jokes they'd like you to tell - try to tell a joke about that.
3. Busking stand-up comedian spend a day in one of the spots where people busk offering to tell jokes for money.  I'm thinking one pound a joke. 5 jokes for three pounds.

### Oral sex
Lots of things sound like a great idea but turn out to be a bad idea.  I read a book about oral sex. No this is real.  It's called "She comes first." And it was lots of good advice about oral sex. Cover the whole area.  Not just the top bit.  Maintain eye contact.  Which can be tricky. But yes.  Good.  Compliment  her on the smell and the taste.

Now this just goes to show that in sex, as in comedy, timing is very important.  Because at this point, compliment a lady on the smell of her vagina is a good idea.  Do it to someone you've never met before on the Jubilee line? You're gonna get funny looks.  See? Timing. 

But finally, when you're getting advance it suggests that you get right in there and put your big front teeth against the clitoris and hum. You're essentially turning yourself into a giant vibrator.  Sounds like a good idea right? But the question then arises.  What are you gonna hum? I always want to hum the damnbusters. You've got the mask on.  You've got things flapping in the wind behind you.

I was not popular.  This gives a whole new meaning to the phrase "not going down well."


### You are what you eat
They say that you are what you eat.  Does that mean that Boris Johnson eats massive cocks?

### Curlers
I have this friend who's into polyamoury.  I rang her up last night on the off-chance she wanted to go out for a drink.

She said "Oh I would do, but I just got the curlers in."

I said "You mean you're doing your hair."

She said "No that's what I call my boyfriends Jeff and Barry."

I said "Why?"

She said "Because they sweep me up and they've got huge stones."

### Elephant in the room 

>> I think it's time ladies and gentlemen that we talk about the elephant in the room, well, if there isn't an elephant in the room, what did I just see in the gents?  Not only had it blocked the u-bend it had cracked the pot. And there was what looked like a trunk-shaped dent in the wall.  Although I suppose it's possible that that was the result of veganuary.
