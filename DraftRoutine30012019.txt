### The Beach Bit

OK, I'm going to try a bit of guided meditation here for a minute. Just imagine that you're on a beach. It's a beautiful sunny day and the sun is beating down. You can hear the seagulls and the sound of the waves breaking on the shore.  You can feel the sun on your face and the warm water and the sand between your toes.

Now the question is, which is the most vivid? Is it the sight of the sand and the sea? Is it the sound of the waves and the seagulls? Or is it the feel of the sand between your toes and the sun on your face.

If it's blue of the sky and the sunlight, that means you're basically a visual person. If it's the sound of the waves you're an aural person.  Sound. Sound you dirty fuckers.  If you're asking how much this holiday cost and if breakfast is included and why they don't serve baked beans you're my fucking uncle Trevor. No seriously, if it's the feel of the sand between your toes that's most vivid, you're probably a serial killer.

### Prostate exam

I went to get my prostate examined by the doctor.  Because you get to a certain age that's what happens.  The doctor is a tiny young Indian lady and she asks me if I'd like a chaperone.  And I was thinking, yes, that's exactly what this situation needs.  An audience.  

So she did the exam and she said that my prostate was nice and smooth - what's the right response to that? Thank you? Is that in any of the etiquette books?

### Unaided Flight

Unaided flight is a thing that birds can do that we humans can't do. Like hanging upsidedown from a bird feeder to get at the peanuts, birds can do it.  Humans can't.  I know - I've tried.

### Bringer Etiquette
I was at an open mic bringer gig a couple of weeks ago and Alastair Campbell's daughter was doing a set. She started out by boasting that she'd bullied someone at school.  Which I thought was a brave move in front of a bunch of comedians. Then her bringer left - halfway through her set and she did 8 minutes instead of eight and then fucked off after her set.  Which I thought was totally out of order, but I suppose if your dad was instrumental in the illegal death of millions of people you're not too worried about the finer points of bringer gig etiquette.

### Fucking Toto

Fucking Toto - "I guess it rains down in Africa." Good fucking guess.  What's it gonna do? Rain up? It's kind of in the definition of rain that it rains down.  That's why it's called precipitation.  If it's raining up.  Either that's plain old evapouration, or maybe it's the end times.

### Wrong routine

Hello.  How are you doing? Look at this! You're here! I'm here! Let's push the tea and bourbons to one side and get fucking.  Ah sorry.  Wrong opening speech.

### World Peace

I would really like world peace.  Actually I don't think world peace isn't enough.  You really need world peace and quiet.  Because if there's world peace but somebody's watching:

* youtube videos
* on their phone
* with the sound on

Sooner or later there's gonna be murders.

### Fucking How Much?

I love living in London and most of the time I just put up with the prices.  But every now and then I have a Yorkshire flashback. It's like the world goes into slow motion and it "Foooookinnnnngin Hooowwwwwww MUCH?"

And at that point, if I did have a machine gun I would just gun down all the staff.

### Do I look like the guy from up?
I was at this comedy competition last week and the compere compared me to the guy from up? I did realise that that was the kind of comparing compere's were supposed to do.
